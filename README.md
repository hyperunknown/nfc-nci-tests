Little playground for [linux_libnfc-nci](https://github.com/NXPNFCLinux/linux_libnfc-nci).

* *poll.c* : first try at discovering tags
* *poll_mt* : multithreaded version with proper handling of incomming tag_info

Don't expect anything in here to actually work, do something useful or be of any further help...
